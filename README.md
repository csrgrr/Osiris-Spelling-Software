# Osiris Spelling Software

## Description

This web application is designed to check and compare every spelling of the name of Osiris from the Middle Kingdom Coffin Texts.

It is based on the Coffin Texts collected in the volumes of Adriaan de Buck (1935-1961) and James P. Allen (2006). The spellings have been registered by hand, so it is possible that it contains some minor error. Double-checking the results obtained is recommended. As a continuation of the studies of the variability of the spellings used in the name of Osiris in this corpus, I decided to introduce these spellings in a database that would serve as the basis for the present Web Application. Osiris Spelling Software allows you to perform complex queries against the aforementioned database and display the data filtered by specified conditions. These conditions are based on the different characteristics that can be deduced from every spelling:

If it is the name of the god or the locution wsir NN pn/tn (used to refer to the deceased).
Type of spelling (according to Manuel de Codage).
Spell.
Document (coffin, tombs, canoptic jars, fragments...).
Time.
Location.
(Other characteristics based on these have been taken into account, such as the position in each document or the number of signs in every spelling)

The data will be displayed in a table that can be ordered at will and on which quick searches can be made. They will also be displayed on charts, based on the number of times each feature is repeated. This makes it easy to compare large amounts of data at a glance.
